\maketitle

This is a small overview of where my files for the Software Engineering course will be placed 
I am not completely sure on where I will put everything but this is my initial setup.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{Github: } \textit{\url{https://github.com/DanteNiewenhuis/RE}} 
    \item[] For github I am planning to put more thought out work like my Portfolio and summaries.
    \item[] \textbf{Drive: } \textit{\url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exf09LYeRfVdYIzBnLlPVWMENsfTiStx?usp=sharing}}
    \item[] On Drive I will put lecture/literature notes and interviews. The content on drive will be less detailed and thought out then what I will put on github.  
    \item[] \textbf{Zoom: } \textit{personal ID :: 570 102 3627 , \url{https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/5701023627?pwd=RG5HSmhpeERBSC9UNlhKcFVNZFp2dz09}}
\end{itemize}
